Studs and Leary discuss how turning on can benefit society.</description>

      <title>Marlon Brando discusses his views on mankind ; part 3</title>
      <description>First broadcast on April 19, 1963. Content Warning:  This conversation includes racially and/or culturally derogatory language and/or negative depictions of Black and Indigenous people of color, women, and LGBTQI+ individuals. Rather than remove this content, we present it in the context of twentieth-century social history to acknowledge and learn from its impact and to inspire awareness and discussion.
In conclusion, Marlon Brando added that his being a famous actor posed an ugly and difficult burden to his son.  Through television, Brando believed that today’s kids are cynical because they’re being sold lies and false truths. Brando’s final thoughts when asked, he wondered why so many microphones were being placed in front of him.  He wondered why people would want to talk to him and/or listen to anything that he had to say.</description>

In a surprising twist, Marlon Brando asks Studs Terkel why he is so obsessed with asking people so many questions and Terkel’s reply was curiosity.  Brando commented that the world is full of atomic bombs and the uncensored life of a politician is a dangerous one. Brando also talks about the meaning of life.</description>

Self-righteousness and values are topics covered by Marlon Brando.  Here in the states, Brando said, we are living a dream.  We do not want strife in our lives, and yet he says it seems as though we seek it.  Brando further explains that even though we have all the advantages, there is no sense of peace and no sense of well-being.  He also stated that people will never see eye to eye.</description>

      <title>Bertrand Russell discusses science and world peace. Phyllis Evans discusses the National Health Plan ; part 1</title>
      <description>Sir Bertrand Russell says scientists have a fundamental obligation to let the authorities know if and when what they&#39;re working on could lead to or cause a war. Russell claims, no matter the side, there are no winners as a result of war. The world could be a far better place, Russell explained, if it weren&#39;t for the fact of man&#39;s hatred toward other men.

If one lives in the United States and has a grave illness or needs a major surgery, Phyllis Evans says one should not have to go into bankruptcy because of all the costs. Evans talks about the National Health Plan where she lives in Wales.</description>

      <title>Buster Keaton discusses the release of &#34;When Comedy Was King&#34;</title>
      <description>First broadcast on September 05, 1960. Silent film pioneer Buster Keaton discusses his career following the release of &#34;When Comedy Was King,&#34; a compilation of some classic shorts by Keaton, Charlie Chaplin, Harold Lloyd, and others. Keaton reveals how they shot the early silent films, generated material and gags, how they planned big chase scenes, the resurging European interest in silent classics, and more. Studs asks Keaton about the stylistic differences between him and Chaplin, whether he would recreate silent films, and how they compare to today&#39;s film-making. Keaton reveals how little was scripted but rather improvised in between a start and finish. Keaton describes some classic gags in films like &#34;The Frozen North,&#34; &#34;Sherlock Jr.,&#34; and &#34;The Navigator.&#34; The discussion concludes with Keaton&#39;s thoughts on performing on television in front of a live audience.</description>
