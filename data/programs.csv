Society needs to understand that expenditures are required to secure the rights of disabled people to live active, productive lives.  They need to be able to get out of their apartment buildings or homes, travel on sidewalks and ride buses.  That may require access ramps, working elevators, cut curbs, and hydraulic buses to lower steps. Disabled people have seen advances in technology, extending their lives but services have not kept up with this need.  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 which guarantees that there can be no discrimination if you receive Federal funds is in danger of being cut by Reagan budget cuts.  This could jeopardize equal education, receiving social services in a quality fashion, non-discrimination in employment and affirmative action legislation.  The rally is a cause for celebration but also a time to rally disabled citizens to call their legislatures and secure their needed programs.  Disabled people pay taxes and should have access to voting booths.","Feb. 28, 1981",1 sound tape reel (ca. 51.36 min.) : 10 1/2 in.,"51 minutes, 35 seconds",WAV,The Chicago History Museum,English,,1981-02-28,1981.0,2.0,28.0,True

The various ""Movements"" from the Women's movement, Black movement, Gay movement and Indian movement is moving culture from a male identity to one of female as person. The Industrial Revolution initially altered the role of women as workers to women as caretakers and now we are seeing a middle class that is changing the relationships of daughters via a higher education to one of supporting themselves and not family through careers.  Mothers must learn that Daughters are their own persons and when Daughters become Mothers that they are not their Mothers.  Separate identities must be established.  Hammer also discusses the three aspects of identity for women which are personal which is knowing that you are separate from your Mother.  Sexual is knowing that your body belongs to you and finally role/gender identity which is based upon society's messages.","Mar. 17, 1976",1 sound tape reel (ca. 52.30 min.) : 10 1/2 in.,"52 minutes, 55 seconds",WAV,The Chicago History Museum,English,,1976-03-17,1976.0,3.0,17.0,True

The interview begins with a clip from Sonia Delaunay, who remarks that Pablo Picasso does not create art, but transforms it. Rosenberg disagrees with this statement, elaborating on his beliefs that tradition and past experiences and influences are present in any work. The desire to create “new” art is also a complicated concept, according to Rosenberg, as art transcends time and can be considered “new” to new viewers. He also discusses the mindset of an action painter, a term he coined, and the spiritual significance that art can have. Terkel and Rosenberg also delve into how technology affects the creation of art and the “cultural boom” of art, in terms of globalization and homogenization.","Apr. 9, 1966",1 sound tape reel (ca. 57.45 min.) : 10 1/2 in.,"57 minutes, 53 seconds",WAV,The Chicago History Museum,English,,1966-04-09,1966.0,4.0,9.0,True

The fact that theater reflects life and life is difficult begins a discussion on the status of theater today.  Habunek, reveals his dissatisfaction with the playwright's ability to find new form to express the world and sees it as not good enough.  Eugene Ionesco with ""The Bald Prima Donna"" appeared to be inclined to show revelations but ""Rhinoceros"" showed nothing new.  He said it all in Prima Donna.  Samuel Beckett's ""Waiting for Godot"" was also an enormous event but Habunek still sees Shakespeare as the person to turn to for depth.

Wilson was initially strongly influenced by Fats Waller and later came to highly admire Earl Hines.  He adapted their clean and clear piano style to his own work.  Wilson aspired to be a classical musician but felt he could not attain the performance level required because his time was spent in jazz.  He was an original member of the Benny Goodman trio alongside both Goodman and Krupa.  He was a part of the first inter racial group to play in public.  Wilson had the ability to dominate as a pianist soloist and enhance the vocalist performances of the likes of Billie Holiday and Mildred Bailey as their accompanist.  The Teddy Wilson Sextet included Edmond Hall on clarinet, Emmett Barry on trumpet, Benny Morton on trombone, Sid Catlet on drums, and Johnny Williams on bass.  Teddy Wilson was very impressed by the  book by Nat Shapiro called "" Hear Me Talkin to Ya: The Story of Jazz as Told By the Men Who Made It.""

Buckminster, Studs Terkel and members of Young Lords tour the Chicago, Lincoln Park neighborhood in a station wagon on route to Buckminster's discussion at People's Church.  Studs Terkel, Richard Buckminster, Cha Cha Jimenez, the Chairman of the Young Lords, and an unidentified female discuss the redevelopment and displacement of citizens by urban renewal in the name of community improvement.  The need for low income housing is not being recognized but middle income housing and commercial shopping malls are being developed for young executives living the suburban dream of white picket fences.  Minorities, both Black and Puerto Rican families have been displaced multiple times in the name of this progress.  Buckminster states ""humanity is innocent but ignorant and we must not knock people down but lift them up.  Even these miserable housing conditions is protection against the weather.""  Buckminster sees Urban Renewal as a complex rationalization of immorality and part of a great cancer.  Yet reminds us that a good thinker doesn't see bad or evil but that they are innocent of how terrible they are.  Buckminster recalls the introduction of the radio and Lindbergh's flight that change the notion of locality and introduced the notion that change is possible.  The radio not education improved the illiterate's vocabularies and opened them to a world outside Chicago.  Buckminster stated not to lose your thinking capacity in anger you must lose the negative and think clearly.  He brought that discussion to the office of the People's Church.  Initially he spoke before a dozen or so Young Lords and neighbors before moving upstairs to a larger audience.  He continued his discussion on how the individual can help his fellow man without trespassing against him.  You must remain independent to think clearly and man's greatest problem is his own fear.  So to make progress you must not create panick and give people confidence and be constructive by not inviting confrontation.  If you follow that approach you will win support.","May. 13, 1970",1 sound tape reel (ca. 56.10 min.) : 10 1/2 in.,"56 minutes, 30 seconds",WAV,The Chicago History Museum,English,,1970-05-13,1970.0,5.0,13.0,True

As a self taught folk harper, she has written a book ""Teach Yourself to Play the Folk Harp"" for the absolute beginner. She is known as a harper and not harpist because she doesn't play the orchestra harp.   She also discusses her involvement musically in a documentary for PBS entitled ""Chicago Secret Wilderness"", produced by Mike Hirsh.  The folk harp is also known as the celtic harp or Irish harp.  It is much smaller than the orchestra harp at three feet.  It has thirty two strings with no sharps or flats.  The C string is colored red and the F blue to distinguish them.  Turlough O'Carolan was a well known harper born in 1670 and died in 1738.  Alan Stivell, Osian Ellis and Nansi Richards Jones, who recently passed away, are influential in this time.  Woods has written a suite of her own entitled ""The Brandiswhiere Suite"" about a magical harper that can change winter to spring.  The album will be out in November and also will have a book illustrated by Steve Duglas entitled ""The Harp of Brandiswhiere: A Suite for Celtic Harp"".
It should be noted that many harps found in museums were discovered hidden in Irish soil because they were outlawed by the British government.  There were also laws in Ireland that designated how many colors classes could wear.  Peasants one, merchants six, Kings eight or nine and harpers seven or eight.  Quite often, harpers, were advisors to Kings.","Sep. 2, 1982",1 sound tape reel (ca. 52.40 min.) : 10 1/2 in.,"52 minutes, 47 seconds",WAV,The Chicago History Museum,English,,1982-09-02,1982.0,9.0,2.0,True

Hall describes the creation of his 6 ft tall by 2 1/2 feet wide painting and how seeing the color of Christ diminishes Christ.  You don't see Christ when you see color.  Hall uses barbed wire instead of thorns in the painting to signify there is no time in painting, it is up to date.  Crucifiction goes on as long as man offends God by offending another man.  Mundy describes the wire as man's imprisonment, torment or his being in a democratic but deeply discriminatory society.  Listeners hear the reactions of a Chicago youth who believes people like the image of Christ to be like them.  The college students in Mundy's Minority Relations course are disturbed by the painting reproduction and title.  Also, four negro nuns at a Liturgical Conference who saw the painting first hand were shocked and hurt by the Black Christ not being worthy of the cross until it was explained that the title was satirical.  Hall believes the painting must create its own mood.

The audio breaks at 25:23 and continues on a Sat at 25:28 till its conclusion at 35:43.  Eric Luth conveys stories of humanity by both German prisoners towards Russian prisoners whose treatment was dictated by the Nazi party to not offer any winter clothing or shoes to provide comfort.  The German laborers provided a human solidarity that brought them food, clothes and soap.  This human element was also found when a Schutzstaffel (SS) officer didn't reprimand either Luth or his female friend who had just conveyed to the SS officer her true feelings on the mistreatment of women by the German Nazis or Gestapo.  Luth has always maintained the importance of maintaining the ability to criticize what went wrong in Hamburg to prevent things from developing and make life better.  There is no progress without the ability to criticize and in this case no harm came because a human element endured.  Luth explains the importance of the BBC London, The Voice of America, and the speeches of Thomas Mann to allow Luth to morally survive this nightmare.  He also conveys how he used his previous relationship in the progressive movement of prison reform prior to the rise of Hitler to be contacted with prison officials who took jobs under Hitler to arrange for Luth to meet with his brother that was in prison.  This meeting and the words exchanged gave his brother new courage to fight on.  The trial of Adolf Eichmann occurred while Luth was in South Africa visiting his daughter.  He offers his views on race relations on how it is the duty of Germans to prevent friends from following the wrong path that they took.

He discusses his struggle to publish the book, after several cancelled contracts with publishers, and critical reviews the book received, which he believes are weakly based. This interview includes interviews with three witnesses of JFK’s assassination, collected by Lane during his investigations. Overall, the author concludes that Warren Commission relied more on “faith” than fact, excluding key witnesses and evidence into their report.

She asks Terkel if he ever swings several times, to which Terkel replies that he is married. They discuss her writing style (Studs calls her work derivative), her efforts to become an intellectual, and other literary works like Greek tragedies and the writing of John O’Hara. Armstrong-Jones does not reveal any lurid details when she reads a passage from “City of Sin,” replacing any romantic action with the word “blank.” Finally, they close by discussing her musical ventures; she’s working on an opera, and Terkel introduces a folk song she penned, but that song is not included in this recording.",1970,1 sound tape reel (ca. 57 min.) : 10 1/2 in.,"57 minutes, 54 seconds",WAV,The Chicago History Museum,English,,,,,,True

Luth is the retired Press Chief of Hamburg and has also helped with remunerations for the Jewish people in the aftermath of World War II.  He has also facilitated detente between Israel and West Germany.  He coordinated a Week of Brotherhood at the Bergen Belsen Concentration Camp where Anne Frank was said to be and the youth numbering over 5,000 seeing the other mass burials decided that all the dead should be honored because they are our brethren.  New generations must be reminded of this.  Luth believes they are dealing with three generations.  The parents who may have kept quiet or took part, their children and now the new children born since the bomb.  Rudolf Augstein, editor of Der Spiegel, coined them ""the children from year zero"".  This is a riveting discussion of how humans can bear only so much truth before they shut down.  So truth must be given in doses so the ears and heads of Germans can digest this.  The elder generations are well aware of the threat of repressing the historical truth and are looking for ways to prevent this.

Unlike American theaters, Germany has over 200 theaters that are subsidized and each town of 50,000 has a theater.  Just like the days of The People's Stage (which still exists) the grocer and cobbler of Germany enjoy the theater.  They are as devoted to the theater as going to a museum or church.  They are treated to 12 to 16 new or old plays from Sophocles to Sartre or Pinter.  It is a feeling of belonging to the enlightened social class but it can be taken to seriously.
Beyond discussing the structure and organization of the theater, Luft discusses Bertolt Brecht.  He found Brecht to be a witty man and as long as they both put politics aside there discussions were memorable.  Although Brecht never found success on Broadway he believed you must have amusement and elegance in producing.
Luft also discusses the new factual plays created by artists such as Peter Weiss that dig into a moment and life of the German people.  He speaks for German youth in that his plays are about bringing things to the open.  Answering why it came about because people want to know.

The discussion spans the years 1938 when Martin Dies  became the first House Committee on Unamerican Activities (HUAC) chairman to Vice President Spiro Agnew's condemnation of the ""New York Times"" and ""Washington Post"".  Vaughn created the title of his book ""Only Victims"" from a Dalton Trumbo speech that reflected back on the era of HUAC as being one where there were no heroes, no villains, only victims.  Society was the victim because HUAC created a fear in society that voicing ones opinions would lead to labels of communism.  As early as 1938, Harry Hopkins' Works Project Administration was under attack.  The Federal Theater which was once considered revolutionary with its use of the ""Living Newspaper"" and casting of black actors in Shakespeare plays as well as integrated ones. This openness became victim to the fear of future investigations for producing socially conscious material and thus the Theater of the Absurd was created. The blacklist was created out of a fear of job loss.  Advertisers, sponsors and networks were riddon with fear and created the Waldorf Agreement which meant not hiring anyone pleading the fifth or first amendment.  Even with the Actors Equity and Broadway League of Theater owners position of not making the theater political but relying on talent as opposed to blacklisting the theater took a position of less controversy during this time.  Only Arthur Miller's ""Crucible"" and ""View From the Bridge"" were truly thought provoking.  HUAC created the 1950's silent generation that feared controversy and only discussed babies and baseball.  However as the country became more affluent and war babies came of age, they could not understand how this affluence did not spread to everyone.  This created the Free Speech Movement and Black Revolution.  Joseph McCarthy's labels of communist did not instill fear in this generation.",1970,1 sound tape reel (ca. 45 min.) : 7 in.,"45 minutes, 45 seconds",WAV,The Chicago History Museum,English,,,,,,True

There were those teachers that joined the party to continue their love of teaching and those teachers that were brought into the Nazi Party to follow their convictions.  This lack of courage to resist influences pupils today because teachers are not saying they were cowards.  The relationship is altered out of shame, and embarrassment.  Luth emphasizes the importance of pausing the horrific truth to allow normal human beings to process the information so that when the explanation of sentence is reached human minds are capable to receive and digest it. Such was the experience with the Adolf Eichmann trial.  Luth emphasizes the importance of ""The Diary of Anne Frank"" and how a visit to the Bergen Belsen Concentration Camp during the Week of Brotherhood influenced German youth.  In visiting the mass burial pyramid of Anne Frank, the youth saw all the other pyramids and realized they are a part of our history and must also be honored. In talking with Terkel, Luth realizes that this event was ten years ago and a new generation of youth who didn't see Hitler's eyes and have seen nothing of the horrors must learn their history but want no part of it.  He believes there are three generations in Germany.  The adults who may have quietly followed Hitler, their children and those born since the bomb.  Luth also acknowledges the development of a new language with this youth movement.  In discussing his visits to Israel, Luth sees Israeli youth as our neighbors and acknowledges that something new must emerge to reach the young who are cut off from the past.  Luth once again discusses Otto Frank's fear that his daughter's message will be lost but Luth tells him that it is a step by step process and soon all libraries will carry a copy of ""The Diary of Anne Frank"".
