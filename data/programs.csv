The two talk about Robeson’s career as an artist before and after his political and social activism began and then identify the turning point in his career that was “Ballad for Americans.”  Robeson’s success and influence were discredited by his support of Soviet Russia, and the government’s efforts to make Robeson a “nonperson” were effective, erasing him from relevancy. Throughout this interview with Gilliam, clips from Robeson’s songs and performances are played, including segments from “Othello” and “Showboat;” “The Canoe Song” from “Sanders from the River;” “Ballad for Americans, ” ""Scandalize My Name"" and segments from religious spirituals. A clip from an interview with J. Mayo ""Ink"" Williams is also played.","Feb. 11, 1977",1 sound tape reel (ca. 60 min.) : 10 1/2 in.,"1 hour, 37 seconds",WAV,The Chicago History Museum,English,,1977-02-11,1977.0,2.0,11.0,False

Society needs to understand that expenditures are required to secure the rights of disabled people to live active, productive lives.  They need to be able to get out of their apartment buildings or homes, travel on sidewalks and ride buses.  That may require access ramps, working elevators, cut curbs, and hydraulic buses to lower steps. Disabled people have seen advances in technology, extending their lives but services have not kept up with this need.  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 which guarantees that there can be no discrimination if you receive Federal funds is in danger of being cut by Reagan budget cuts.  This could jeopardize equal education, receiving social services in a quality fashion, non-discrimination in employment and affirmative action legislation.  The rally is a cause for celebration but also a time to rally disabled citizens to call their legislatures and secure their needed programs.  Disabled people pay taxes and should have access to voting booths.","Feb. 28, 1981",1 sound tape reel (ca. 51.36 min.) : 10 1/2 in.,"51 minutes, 35 seconds",WAV,The Chicago History Museum,English,,1981-02-28,1981.0,2.0,28.0,True

The various ""Movements"" from the Women's movement, Black movement, Gay movement and Indian movement is moving culture from a male identity to one of female as person. The Industrial Revolution initially altered the role of women as workers to women as caretakers and now we are seeing a middle class that is changing the relationships of daughters via a higher education to one of supporting themselves and not family through careers.  Mothers must learn that Daughters are their own persons and when Daughters become Mothers that they are not their Mothers.  Separate identities must be established.  Hammer also discusses the three aspects of identity for women which are personal which is knowing that you are separate from your Mother.  Sexual is knowing that your body belongs to you and finally role/gender identity which is based upon society's messages.","Mar. 17, 1976",1 sound tape reel (ca. 52.30 min.) : 10 1/2 in.,"52 minutes, 55 seconds",WAV,The Chicago History Museum,English,,1976-03-17,1976.0,3.0,17.0,True

Self-righteousness and values are topics covered by Marlon Brando.  Here in the states, Brando said, we are living a dream.  We do not want strife in our lives, and yet he says it seems as though we seek it.

Wilson was initially strongly influenced by Fats Waller and later came to highly admire Earl Hines.  He adapted their clean and clear piano style to his own work.  Wilson aspired to be a classical musician but felt he could not attain the performance level required because his time was spent in jazz.  He was an original member of the Benny Goodman trio alongside both Goodman and Krupa.  He was a part of the first inter racial group to play in public.  Wilson had the ability to dominate as a pianist soloist and enhance the vocalist performances of the likes of Billie Holiday and Mildred Bailey as their accompanist.  The Teddy Wilson Sextet included Edmond Hall on clarinet, Emmett Barry on trumpet, Benny Morton on trombone, Sid Catlet on drums, and Johnny Williams on bass.  Teddy Wilson was very impressed by the  book by Nat Shapiro called "" Hear Me Talkin to Ya: The Story of Jazz as Told By the Men Who Made It.""

Buckminster states ""humanity is innocent but ignorant and we must not knock people down but lift them up.  Even these miserable housing conditions is protection against the weather.""  Buckminster sees Urban Renewal as a complex rationalization of immorality and part of a great cancer.  Yet reminds us that a good thinker doesn't see bad or evil but that they are innocent of how terrible they are.  Buckminster recalls the introduction of the radio and Lindbergh's flight that change the notion of locality and introduced the notion that change is possible.  The radio not education improved the illiterate's vocabularies and opened them to a world outside Chicago.  Buckminster stated not to lose your thinking capacity in anger you must lose the negative and think clearly.  He brought that discussion to the office of the People's Church.  Initially he spoke before a dozen or so Young Lords and neighbors before moving upstairs to a larger audience.  He continued his discussion on how the individual can help his fellow man without trespassing against him.  You must remain independent to think clearly and man's greatest problem is his own fear.  So to make progress you must not create panick and give people confidence and be constructive by not inviting confrontation.  If you follow that approach you will win support.","May. 13, 1970",1 sound tape reel (ca. 56.10 min.) : 10 1/2 in.,"56 minutes, 30 seconds",WAV,The Chicago History Museum,English,,1970-05-13,1970.0,5.0,13.0,True

Society needs to understand that expenditures are required to secure the rights of disabled people to live active, productive lives.  They need to be able to get out of their apartment buildings or homes, travel on sidewalks and ride buses.  That may require access ramps, working elevators, cut curbs, and hydraulic buses to lower steps. Disabled people have seen advances in technology, extending their lives but services have not kept up with this need.  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 which guarantees that there can be no discrimination if you receive Federal funds is in danger of being cut by Reagan budget cuts.  This could jeopardize equal education, receiving social services in a quality fashion, non-discrimination in employment and affirmative action legislation.  The rally is a cause for celebration but also a time to rally disabled citizens to call their legislatures and secure their needed programs.

As a self taught folk harper, she has written a book ""Teach Yourself to Play the Folk Harp"" for the absolute beginner. She is known as a harper and not harpist because she doesn't play the orchestra harp.   She also discusses her involvement musically in a documentary for PBS entitled ""Chicago Secret Wilderness"", produced by Mike Hirsh.  The folk harp is also known as the celtic harp or Irish harp.  It is much smaller than the orchestra harp at three feet.  It has thirty two strings with no sharps or flats.  The C string is colored red and the F blue to distinguish them.  Turlough O'Carolan was a well known harper born in 1670 and died in 1738.  Alan Stivell, Osian Ellis and Nansi Richards Jones, who recently passed away, are influential in this time.  Woods has written a suite of her own entitled ""The Brandiswhiere Suite"" about a magical harper that can change winter to spring.  The album will be out in November and also will have a book illustrated by Steve Duglas entitled ""The Harp of Brandiswhiere: A Suite for Celtic Harp"".
It should be noted that many harps found in museums were discovered hidden in Irish soil because they were outlawed by the British government.  There were also laws in Ireland that designated how many colors classes could wear.  Peasants one, merchants six, Kings eight or nine and harpers seven or eight.  Quite often, harpers, were advisors to Kings.","Sep. 2, 1982",1 sound tape reel (ca. 52.40 min.) : 10 1/2 in.,"52 minutes, 47 seconds",WAV,The Chicago History Museum,English,,1982-09-02,1982.0,9.0,2.0,True

Rather than remove this content, we present it in the context of twentieth-century social history to acknowledge and learn from its impact and to inspire awareness and discussion.

Verna Bloom continues to talk about how scared she was when being arrested. Bloom said she was hand-cuffed for an hour. One of Bloom's friends was able to smooth things over with the police and she was finally released. Bloom wanted her story known because her arrest, for doing nothing, was outrageous. 

The woman behind the cigar counter believed the protesting that took place last week at the Democratic National Convention was brought on by out-of-town instigators and she explained that they were staged events. In the end, she liked Mayor Daley more now because of how he & the police protected the city.

When asked about the protesters from last week, the cab driver started to talk about law and order and justice for the little people. He said rules in place, should be for both Black people and white people. With or without money, white people who break the law need to be punished, too, explained the cab driver.",1968,,"27 minutes, 50 seconds",,,,,,,,,True

Robert Vaughn talks with Studs Terkel,https://s3.amazonaws.com/wfmt-studs-terkel/published/12913.mp3,/programs/robert-vaughn-talks-studs-terkel,"Robert Vaughn takes time out from his Drury Lane appearance in ""Tender Trap"" to discuss his new book ""Only Victims"" with Studs Terkel.  The discussion spans the years 1938 when Martin Dies  became the first House Committee on Unamerican Activities (HUAC) chairman to Vice President Spiro Agnew's condemnation of the ""New York Times"" and ""Washington Post"".  Vaughn created the title of his book ""Only Victims"" from a Dalton Trumbo speech that reflected back on the era of HUAC as being one where there were no heroes, no villains, only victims.  Society was the victim because HUAC created a fear in society that voicing ones opinions would lead to labels of communism.  As early as 1938, Harry Hopkins' Works Project Administration was under attack.  The Federal Theater which was once considered revolutionary with its use of the ""Living Newspaper"" and casting of black actors in Shakespeare plays as well as integrated ones. This openness became victim to the fear of future investigations for producing socially conscious material and thus the Theater of the Absurd was created. The blacklist was created out of a fear of job loss.  Advertisers, sponsors and networks were riddon with fear and created the Waldorf Agreement which meant not hiring anyone pleading the fifth or first amendment.  Even with the Actors Equity and Broadway League of Theater owners position of not making the theater political but relying on talent as opposed to blacklisting the theater took a position of less controversy during this time.  Only Arthur Miller's ""Crucible"" and ""View From the Bridge"" were truly thought provoking.  HUAC created the 1950's silent generation that feared controversy and only discussed babies and baseball.  However as the country became more affluent and war babies came of age, they could not understand how this affluence did not spread to everyone.  This created the Free Speech Movement and Black Revolution.  Joseph McCarthy's labels of communist did not instill fear in this generation.",1970,1 sound tape reel (ca. 45 min.) : 7 in.,"45 minutes, 45 seconds",WAV,The Chicago History Museum,English,,,,,,True

George Drossos talks about first moving to Chicago and getting acclimated to the city. He recalls visiting other states for a month and then having that feeling of ""nostos,"" or wanting to return home to Chicago.

A mother of 15 children and 21 grandchildren, Mrs. Thacker said she doesn't like all the hoodlum business that goes on in Chicago. Thacker said we live in a very, very sinful world and that one day, she hopes her children and grandchildren grow up in a peaceful world.

Nineteen-year-old Danny Thacker hopes to be an electrical engineer one day. He talks about how he works 9 hours a day, how he needs to let off some steam from work and then he says his routine is pretty much the same daily.

Mrs. Webb lives in a room behind their corner store. She says she doesn't get out much because she hears that purses get stolen and one can get whopped in the head. Webb says she tries to get along with everyone but that she gets really mad when kids swipe items out of her store without paying for them.

Benny Bearskin said he moved to Chicago from Nebraska because here in Chicago, he would receive 50 paychecks a year. Being a Native American, Bearskin said he didn't encountered any racism at the different places he worked because they were only concerned with job performance. For Bearskin, being a Native American Indian, he explained, is a great source of pride.",1968,1 sound tape reel (ca. 60 min.) : 10 1/2 in.,"1 hour, 29 seconds",WAV,The Chicago History Museum,English,,,,,,True

Former Assistant Warden of the Cook County Jail, Hans W.

Mattick says there's an over-crowding problem at the jail, that anywhere between 1600-2400 inmates are there daily. When the jail was built, the thought was to only house men inmates, however, they soon learned women commit crimes, too. The space that was reserved for the hospital became the housing space for women, and as a result, the jail didn't have a hospital for a year.",1968,1 sound tape reel (ca. 60 min.) : 7 in.,"57 minutes, 46 seconds",WAV,The Chicago History Museum,English,,,,,,True

Unlike American theaters, Germany has over 200 theaters that are subsidized and each town of 50,000 has a theater.  Just like the days of The People's Stage (which still exists) the grocer and cobbler of Germany enjoy the theater.  They are as devoted to the theater as going to a museum or church.  They are treated to 12 to 16 new or old plays from Sophocles to Sartre or Pinter.  It is a feeling of belonging to the enlightened social class but it can be taken to seriously.
Beyond discussing the structure and organization of the theater, Luft discusses Bertolt Brecht.  He found Brecht to be a witty man and as long as they both put politics aside there discussions were memorable.  Although Brecht never found success on Broadway he believed you must have amusement and elegance in producing.
Luft also discusses the new factual plays created by artists such as Peter Weiss that dig into a moment and life of the German people.  He speaks for German youth in that his plays are about bringing things to the open.  Answering why it came about because people want to know.

There were those teachers that joined the party to continue their love of teaching and those teachers that were brought into the Nazi Party to follow their convictions.  This lack of courage to resist influences pupils today because teachers are not saying they were cowards.  The relationship is altered out of shame, and embarrassment.  Luth emphasizes the importance of pausing the horrific truth to allow normal human beings to process the information so that when the explanation of sentence is reached human minds are capable to receive and digest it. Such was the experience with the Adolf Eichmann trial.  Luth emphasizes the importance of ""The Diary of Anne Frank"" and how a visit to the Bergen Belsen Concentration Camp during the Week of Brotherhood influenced German youth.  In visiting the mass burial pyramid of Anne Frank, the youth saw all the other pyramids and realized they are a part of our history and must also be honored. In talking with Terkel, Luth realizes that this event was ten years ago and a new generation of youth who didn't see Hitler's eyes and have seen nothing of the horrors must learn their history but want no part of it.  He believes there are three generations in Germany.  The adults who may have quietly followed Hitler, their children and those born since the bomb.  Luth also acknowledges the development of a new language with this youth movement.  In discussing his visits to Israel, Luth sees Israeli youth as our neighbors and acknowledges that something new must emerge to reach the young who are cut off from the past.  Luth once again discusses Otto Frank's fear that his daughter's message will be lost but Luth tells him that it is a step by step process and soon all libraries will carry a copy of ""The Diary of Anne Frank"".

She believes that the sanctuary offered to skyjackers by the United States and other countries, in addition to the “folk hero” status they often receive, contributes to the prevalence of this crime. Terkel and her also touch on the role of sky marshals and discuss her specific interviews with skyjackers, and Rich proposes that to stop this trend, the world should enforce and ratify international agreements banning sanctuary and ransom for skyjackers.",1970,1 sound tape reel (ca. 43.05 min.) : 10 1/2 in.,"43 minutes, 14 seconds",WAV,The Chicago History Museum,English,,,,,,True

The audio breaks at 25:23 and continues on a Sat at 25:28 till its conclusion at 35:43.  Erich Luth conveys stories of humanity by both German prisoners towards Russian prisoners whose treatment was dictated by the Nazi party to not offer any winter clothing or shoes to provide comfort.  The German laborers provided a human solidarity that brought them food, clothes, and soap.  This human element was also found when a Schutzstaffel (SS) officer didn't reprimand either Luth or his female friend who had just conveyed to the SS officer her true feelings on the mistreatment of women by the German Nazis or Gestapo.  Luth has always maintained the importance of maintaining the ability to criticize what went wrong in Hamburg to prevent things from developing and make life better.  There is no progress without the ability to criticize and in this case, no harm came because a human element endured.  Luth explains the importance of the BBC London, The Voice of America, and the speeches of Thomas Mann to allow Luth to morally survive this nightmare.  He also conveys how he used his previous relationship in the progressive movement of prison reform prior to the rise of Hitler to be contacted with prison officials who took jobs under Hitler to arrange for Luth to meet with his brother that was in prison.  This meeting and the words exchanged gave his brother new courage to fight on.  The trial of Adolf Eichmann occurred while Luth was in South Africa visiting his daughter.  He offers his views on race relations on how it is the duty of Germans to prevent friends from following the wrong path that they took.
